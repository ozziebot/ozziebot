  <h1>About me </h1>
  <p>
    I am a Computer Science major with a concentration in software development. Currently, I'm completing
    an internship with the company Ulta Beauty. Working specifically under their Bella application that is
    in charge of their salon service. Technologies I've most recently used have been Confluence,
    Jira, Cherwell, and DBeaver. I am currently in search for any software related positions within
    the computer science realm. I am most comfortable using the language of Java, but I am always willing
    to learn and excel in new languages. This spring I will complete my undergrad in Computer Science
    and search for more opportunities.
